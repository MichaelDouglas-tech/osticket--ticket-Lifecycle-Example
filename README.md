The osTicket life cycle describes how a support ticket is created, processed, and resolved within the helpdesk system. It’s essentially the journey a customer’s issue takes from the moment it’s reported until it’s closed. Here’s a clear step-by-step explanation:

1. Ticket Creation

A ticket is created when a customer submits a request.

This can happen through multiple channels:

Email (converted into a ticket by the system),

The web portal (customer fills out a support form),

Or by staff creating a ticket on behalf of the customer.

At this stage, the system assigns a unique ticket number and captures details like the user, issue, and department.

2. Ticket Assignment

Once created, tickets are routed to the appropriate department based on predefined rules (e.g., “Billing” vs. “Technical Support”).

A ticket can be:

Auto-assigned (using rules like keywords or source),

Or manually assigned by a supervisor or agent.

Assignment ensures the right person or team handles the issue.

3. Ticket Response

The assigned agent responds to the ticket:

Acknowledges receipt of the issue,

May ask clarifying questions,

Or starts providing a solution.

All communication is tracked within the ticket thread for visibility.

4. Ticket Status Tracking

Each ticket carries a status that reflects its stage in the process:

Open → Waiting to be worked on,

Answered → Agent replied, awaiting customer response,

In Progress → Under investigation,

Resolved/Closed → Issue completed.

Agents update statuses as they progress, and customers are notified automatically.

5. Ticket Escalation (if needed)

If a ticket isn’t resolved in a timely manner, escalation rules can:

Reassign it to another agent or manager,

Trigger alerts,

Or change priority (e.g., from “Normal” to “High”).

This prevents tickets from being forgotten or delayed.

6. Ticket Resolution

When the issue is solved, the agent marks the ticket as Closed.

A resolution note may be added for records.

Customers are typically notified of closure, with the option to reopen if the issue persists.

7. Ticket Archival & Reporting

Closed tickets remain in the system for record-keeping and reporting.

Managers can run analytics to track:

Ticket volume,

Response/Resolution times,

Agent productivity,

Common issues or recurring problems.

👉 In summary:
The osTicket life cycle flows as: Ticket Creation → Assignment → Response → Status Updates → (Escalation if needed) → Resolution → Archival/Reporting.# osticket--ticket-Lifecycle-Example
